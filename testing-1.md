Unit testing is a level of software **testing** where individual units/components of a software are tested.

## Unit testing benefits:

* Improves your application architecture and maintainability.
* They are very fast to run allowing us to very quickly understand if there is anything broken in our app.
* They bring great value with the least amount of effort as they are very easy to write compared to other more complicated tests.
* If they fail it is very easy to know where the error is because they only concentrate on small units of code.

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.
