Unit testing is a level of software **testing** where individual units/components of a software are tested.

## Unit testing benefits:

* Improves your application architecture and maintainability.
* They are very fast to run allowing us to very quickly understand if there is anything broken in our app.
* They bring great value with the least amount of effort as they are very easy to write compared to other more complicated tests.
* If they fail it is very easy to know where the error is because they only concentrate on small units of code.
