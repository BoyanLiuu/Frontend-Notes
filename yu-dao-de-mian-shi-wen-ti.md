2. Difference between let,const, var
3. How to handle browse css issue
4. what is the difference between vue and react?
5. What is the difference between typescript and javascript.
6. What are some updates about react?
7. **Difference between  vue and react**
   * **Difference**
     1. Vue uses HTML templates and JSX, while React only uses JSX, which is essentially an extension that allows you to insert HTML directly into JS code. While JSX can speed up and simplify larger, more complex tasks, the downside is that it can also complicate what should be an easy task.
     2. Vue have syntax sugar such as  v-if v-for
     3. React’s core offerings are components, DOM manipulation, and component state management. Everything else is developed and supported by the community. While seasoned developers often prefer this level of freedom, newbies may feel overwhelmed by the abundance of third-party libraries and tools.
   * **Same**:&#x20;
     * One of the biggest similarities between Vue.js and React is the usage of what’s called a ‘Virtual DOM’. A Virtual DOM is basically what it sounds like, a virtual representation of the DOM tree.
     * Both React and Vue.js encourage a component based architecture. This essentially means separating your application into distinct chunks of related functionality with a defined way for each chunk to ‘talk’ to each other.
8. What is the advantage of using Next.js?
   * It is react framework for production, a fullstack framework for react,
   * It solves common problems and makes building react apps easiers, It builds on react and it enhances react by adding many core features which you have to add to react apps on your own otherwise, such as routing and many more
   * **It provides hybrid static & server rendering:**
     * It preparing all the content of a page on the server instead of on the client.
     * We do not includes any data when we inspect source code in traditional react, you only have basic html skeleton. All the other part is rendering by client side library like react.
       * user need to wait for the data loaded to see something on the screen
       * Have **search optimization problem**,search engine can not see the valuable data, this does not matter for all pages, like a  dashboard login page.
   * **It provides File base routing**
     * In react , you need to write extra code, then it end up storing component as pages in a separate folder
   * **fullstack capabilities**
     * that works with file system,or reach out to a database(storing data,getting data,authentication)
     * easy to add our own backend api into our react project using nodejs,
     * we do not need to build another restful api project
