# Testing

## Types of testing

I am using Jest

* Unit tests
  *  easiest to implement
  * It should cover all small pure function
* Integration Tests
  * How a function work with another function 
  * It tests how each components work together
  * They are expensive , takes time to develop
* Automation Tests
  * It always run inside a browser, it simulates user behavior  and need to make sure  these action actually work from user point of view
  * It is hardest to set up
  * **cypress**
